      <h1>A bit about me</h1>
      <p>
        I was born and raised in Southern California my whole life. Although, I
        have moved to different cities within SoCal for many different reasons.
        I currently have no prior working experience. But, hopefully learning
        and understanding of the different types of programming languages and
        possible internship opportunities will help with getting a job within
        the field that I enjoy in the near future.
      </p>
      <h1>Hobbies</h1>
      <p>
        Growing up, I liked using my family computer a lot to either play games
        or watch Youtube videos. I occasionally like to stream on Youtube for
        fun
