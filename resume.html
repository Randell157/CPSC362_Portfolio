            I am a person that focuses on the task at hand and complete it as
            soon as possible

          <li>
            If a problem were to occur, I would logically think about what the
            best solution would be in a reasonable amont of time and act upon it
          </li>
          <li>
            When working with other people, I like to make sure that everyone is
            on the right page
          </li>
          <li>
            I also like to make sure that everyone is comfortable with the
            environment around them, whether that would be project related or
            personal reasons
